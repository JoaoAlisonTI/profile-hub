## Overview
### About
I started developing My Profile Links during the end of 2023, initially I had in mind to do a small project to test the Shadcn ui as well as my knowledge in React + TS (It's always good to sharpen the ax üòÖ). So I thought about "recreating" an old project made with HTML/CSS that brought together contact links (Like Linktree) but now made with new technologies. 

I already had the structure in mind so I just looked for colors that were pleasant to me and that wouldn't bother the visitor too much (This was the most challenging part). 

I used Shadcn ui to create the buttons and the profile component (Shadcn ui uses Tailwind CSS to do styling so it was very good to test), to display the buttons I used an Array of objects to better organize the information for each button. 

This was another project developed for my portfolio, developed on my cell phone üì≤ (I don't have a computer at the moment...).

## My process
### Technologies
### ‚öôÔ∏èüë®‚Äçüíª
This project was built with the following technologies:

- React.js + Vite.js
- Typescript
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn ui
- Git/Github

### Continued development
I intend to add the dark/light mode to the project for those who prefer a light mode so it is possible to change it.
